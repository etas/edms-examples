# Concepts

ROS 2 and EDMS are based on different, yet comparable concepts.

The following sections focus on specific concepts and offer a detailed comparison between the two middleware solutions.
- [Software Architecture Middleware Abstraction](Software_Architecture_Middleware_Abstraction/README.md): This section compares the software architecture and middleware abstraction strategies used by ROS 2 and EDMS, focusing on modularity and resource management.
- [Nodes vs Activities & Runnables](Nodes_vs_Activities_&_Runnables/README.md): This section compares ROS 2 Nodes with EDMS Activities and Runnables, highlighting how each system organizes and manages execution entities.
- [Topics vs Interfaces](Topics_vs_Interfaces/README.md): This section compares ROS 2 Topics with EDMS Interfaces, focusing on how data is transmitted and structured in both systems.
- [Execution Management](Execution_Management/README.md): This section discusses how the execution of functional entities is managed in ROS 2 and EDMS, with a focus on callback-driven execution in ROS 2 vs. Directed-Acyclic-Graph(DAG)-based execution model in EDMS.
- [Memory Resources](Memory_Resources/README.md): This section compares memory management strategies in ROS 2 and EDMS, emphasizing zero-copy techniques and shared memory optimization in EDMS.
- [Parameters](Parameters/README.md): This section contrasts how ROS 2 Parameters and EDMS Internal States are used for managing configuration and runtime data.
