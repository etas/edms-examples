# Comparison of ROS 2 and ETAS Deterministic Middleware Solution (EDMS)

This project provides both a conceptual and practical comparison of ROS 2 with ETAS Deterministic Middleware Solution (EDMS) applications.

The goal is to

* make the commonalities and differences transparent and understandable (conceptual level)
* help developers who come from ROS 2 world to migrate to EDMS
* help technical decision makers to understand the benefits of EDMS over ROS 2

To achieve this, the project provides

* documentation that describes ROS 2 concepts and compares them to EDMS
* practical tutorials with side-by-side comparison implementations of ROS 2-based applications with their EDMS equivalent
* guides with step-by-step instructions for common tasks
