# Tutorials

The tutorials are a collection of step-by-step instructions meant to steadily build skills in EDMS.

The best way to approach the tutorials is to walk through them for the first time in order, as they build off of each other and are not meant to be comprehensive documentation.

1. **[Hello World Model](Hello_World/README.md)** 
2. **[Producer and Subscriber Model (EDMS vs. ROS 2)](Producer_Consumer/README.md)**
3. **[Process Communications Model (EDMS vs. ROS 2)](Process_Communication/README.md)**
4. **[Communication Latency Comparisons (EDMS vs. ROS 2)](Communication_Latency/README.md)**

For quick solutions to more specific questions, see the [How-to Guides](../how_to_guides/README.md).
