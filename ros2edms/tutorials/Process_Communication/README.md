# Process Communication Models

In this tutorial you will get instructions to set up an interprocess-communication- and intraprocess-communication-model (a simple model sending numbers and forwarding them each second) in ROS 2 as well as in EDMS.

You can access the details descriptions to set up the applications here:

- **[Process_Communication_EDMS](Process_Communication_EDMS/README.md)**
- **[Process_Communication_ROS2](Process_Communication_ROS2/README.md)**
